# ML reconstruction of PIV snapshots, this is a git test
In this project, gappy regions of PIV vector maps are constructed by machine learning algorithms as well as popular statistical interpolation techniques.


# Instruction for using the codes
The main file for execution of program is "main.py" existed in the "Code" folder. All other files are moduels and class files defined for different purposes. 
A sample data is located in the data folder, including 5 PIV snapshots for FOV2.
